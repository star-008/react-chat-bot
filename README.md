# Get Started

You need Node.js v4.0+ to run these commands. Prefer using `yarn` over `npm`.

- To get things running, first install the dependencies using `yarn` or `npm i`
- To run the server, use `yarn start` or `npm start` and the server would be running on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
- To create a build, use `yarn build` or `npm run build`

# Firebase hosting deploy

- Copy all from `build` folder to `firebase_hosting` folder.
- `firebase deploy`
